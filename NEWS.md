- 2021-08-09 : Version 1.1.0 has been released!
  - Updated LAMMPS version from [patch_8Apr2021](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/patch_8Apr2021) -> [patch_30Jul2021](https://github.com/lammps/lammps/releases/tag/patch_30Jul2021).  This was done because a critical bug related to accessing indices of multidimensional objects, e.g. computes, was introduced into LAMMPS in the patch_10Feb2021 release and was only fixed in patch_30Jul2021.  There were also changes made to some packages related to either the syntax for some pair styles or validity checks that LAMMPS performs on parameter files used by some pair styles, which has led to new versions of some simulator models being published on openkim.org.
